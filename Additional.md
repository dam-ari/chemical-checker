CHEMICALS KNOWN TO THE STATE TO CAUSE CANCER OR REPRODUCTIVE TOXICITY

The Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986 requires that the Governor revise and republish at least once per year the list of chemicals known to the State to cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. For easy reference, chemicals which are newly added are shown in underline. Chemicals or endpoints shown in strikeout were placed on the Proposition 65 list on the date noted, and have subsequently been removed. A hyperlink is provided for the basis for removing the chemical.							
In the Listing Mechanism column, "AB" denotes authoritative bodies, "SQE" denotes State's Qualified Experts, "FR" denotes formally required to be labeled or identified, and "LC" denotes Labor Code. For those chemicals for which the basis for listing documentation is available electronically, a hyperlink to the documentation is provided. The identification number indicated in the following list is the Chemical Abstracts Service (CAS) Registry Number. No CAS number is given when several substances are presented as a single listing. The date refers to the initial appearance of the chemical on the list. For those chemicals for which a no significant risk level (NSRL) for carcinogens or maximum allowable dose level (MADL) for reproductive toxicants has been adopted, it is denoted in the column, "NSRL or MADL." For those NSRLs or MADLs for which the risk assessment documentation is available electronically, a hyperlink to the documentation is provided.

a Where a source or product results in exposures by multiple routes, the total exposure must be considered.  For example, the MADL for benzene is exceeded when the absorbed dose exceeds 24 µg/day.  If only inhalation and oral exposure occurs, the benzene MADL is exceeded when:  (oral dose ÷ 24 µg/day) + (inhalation dose ÷ 49 µg/day) > 1.0.					
b Levels for male children and adolescents were calculated by application of the default bodyweights specified in Section 25703(a)(8) to the procedure specified in Sections 25801 and 25803					
c Level represents absorbed dose (rounded from 6,525 µg/day ).  Since 100% of ingested toluene is absorbed, oral dose is equivalent to administered dose.  It is assumed that roughly 50% of the dose administered by the inhalation route is absorbed.  Therefore the MADL for inhaled toluene is 13,000 µg/day (rounded from 13,050 µg/day ), corresponding to an absorbed dose of 6,525 µg/day.					
d Butyl benzyl phthalate MADL was adopted June 25, 2013, but pursuant to Government Code section 11343.4 it becomes effective October 1, 2013.					
e Sulfur dioxide MADL was adopted July 11, 2013, but pursuant to Government Code section 11343.4 it becomes effective October 1, 2013.					
f Hydrogen cyanide and cyanide salts MADLs were adopted on August 7, 2013, but pursuant to Government Code section 11343.4 they become effective October 1, 2013.
